#Introduction/Background
We aim to improve accuracy  and reduce costs associated with human inspection by using machine learning to identify tumors 

#Methods
We are utilizing a dataset of 4600 X-ray scans of the human brain with and without tumors (45% / 55% split) and techniques such as image segmentation and soft clustering.

#Results
We hope to develop a model that analyzes images to correctly indicate the presence of tumors. Binary classification will indicate whether a tumor is present or not.

#Discussion:
If a model could accurately determine the presence of brain tumors, healthcare workflows would experience significant boosts in speed and efficiency. With a high volume
of scans entering the pipeline every day, radiologists and other medical professionals often find themselves overwhelmed, especially in situations where budget cuts 
lead to understaffing. An AI specializing in brain scans would certainly alleviate bottlenecks that occur in the diagnostic process, primarily through the ability to
produce potentially quicker and more accurate diagnoses than a certified doctor could. Consequently, this would expand doctors' bandwidth and allow them more time to
focus on non-brain scans, knowing that the brain-related scans would be handled by an AI. 

Perhaps most importantly, a successful implementation of such an AI would encourage healthcare experts to explore future applications of machine learning that could
improve diagnostic medicine. For instance, an upgraded version of this project's AI might identify tumor types and suggest recommended treatment options based on the
tumor type. To prevent machine learning from completely eliminating current jobs, AIs could simply be designed to analyze doctors' reports and flag any where the diagnosis
doesn't match the AI's diagnosis. Doing this before delivering results to patients would save time, money, and resources that would otherwise go towards handling false
diagnoses.
