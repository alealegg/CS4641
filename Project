#Introduction/Background
We aim to improve accuracy  and reduce costs associated with human inspection by using machine learning to identify tumors 

#Infographic

#Methods
We are utilizing a dataset of 4600 X-ray scans of the human brain with and without tumors (45% / 55% split) and techniques such as image segmentation and soft clustering.

#Results
We hope to develop a model that analyzes images to correctly indicate the presence of tumors

#Discussion:
If a model could accurately determine the presence of a brain tumor, healthcare workflows could experience significant boosts in speed and efficiency
A perfect next step would be an AI that could identify the type of tumor and list recommended treatment based on the tumor type
